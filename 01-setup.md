**Section 1: Introduction and Setup**

In this lab, we will build a community-supported agriculture application using an Express.js app generated by the `express-generator`. We will use Passport.js for authenticating our API using a username and password strategy, Sequelize.js as our ORM, and PostgreSQL as our database. Our application will serve the following resources: `baskets`, `items`, `users`, and `orders`.

Before we start, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Node.js and npm installed on your system
2. PostgreSQL installed and configured on your system

Now that you have everything set up, let's begin by generating our Express.js application.

**Step 1.1: Generate the Express.js application**

Run the following command to generate an Express.js application with the desired options:

```bash
npx express-generator --no-view --git csa-app
```

- The `--git` flag tells `express-generator` to make a `.gitignore` file for you. That's good.

Change your working directory to the newly created application:

```bash
cd csa-app
```

Make this directory a Git repository:

```bash
git init
```

Go ahead and push it up to GitHub so that you are ready to submit the link when the time comes.

**Step 1.2: Install dependencies**

Run the following command to install the required dependencies for our application:

```bash
npm install
```

Add `nodemon`:

```bash
npm install -d nodemon
```

Modify the `"start"` script in the `package.json` to use the `nodemon` command instead of `node`:

```javascript
"start": "nodemon ./bin/www"
```

**Step 1.3: Install additional dependencies**

We will be using Passport.js (+ bycrypt for password encryption), Sequelize.js, and PostgreSQL. Install these additional dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install passport passport-local sequelize pg pg-hstore bcryptjs
```

You should now have a basic Express.js application generated, and the required dependencies installed. You can start the application by running:

```bash
npm start
```

With our project set up, we can proceed to the next section.
